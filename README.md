# ETL PROJECT
### This project takes raw data from the public MRTS database and performs Extract, Transform, and Load operations into a MySQL account using Python.
#### This project also:
1. Creates a pandas dataframe from a foler of CSV files
2. Creates a Database, tables, and inputs cleaned data from the MRTS CSV folder in MySQL
3. Submits queries to the MySQL database for analysis

##Goals: My goal is continue to improve the presentation of my GIT projects as I go along. This Project may not be the best indicator of my abilites as they continue to Grow. I will be putting other projects on this site as time allows.
